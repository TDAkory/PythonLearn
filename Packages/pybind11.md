# [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code.

## pybind11 can map the following core C++ features to Python:

* Functions accepting and returning custom data structures per value, reference, or pointer

* Instance methods and static methods

* Overloaded functions

* Instance attributes and static attributes

* Arbitrary exception types

* Enumerations

* Callbacks

* Iterators and ranges

* Custom operators

* Single and multiple inheritance

* STL data structures

* Smart pointers with reference counting like std::shared_ptr

* Internal references with correct reference counting

* C++ classes with virtual (and pure virtual) methods can be extended in Python
